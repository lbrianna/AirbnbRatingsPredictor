# Airbnb Ratings Prediction Model 🏡🌟

Welcome to the Airbnb Ratings Prediction Model repository! 🚀

## Project Overview 📊
This repository presents an Airbnb ratings prediction model developed to forecast guest ratings based on various features.

## Project Roadmap 🗺️
This project follows a structured approach:

1. **Data Exploration**: Load the Airbnb dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Dive into data insights to understand relationships and prepare for modeling.
3. **Data Preparation**: Handle missing values, perform one-hot encoding, and create new features.
4. **Model Selection**: Implement and evaluate Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest models.
5. **Stacking Ensemble**: Combine top-performing models using a Stacking Regressor.
6. **Results Analysis**: Examine model performance, identify strengths and limitations, and unearth unmodeled factors.

## Get Started 🚀
To explore the project:

1. **Clone**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/airbnb-ratings-prediction.git`.
2. **Explore**: Open `airbnb_ratings_prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook for detailed code, analysis, and insights.

## Conclusion 🎉
While the project provides predictive models for Airbnb ratings, it also highlights the need for additional features like location and amenities. The journey showcases model strengths and weaknesses, offering a foundation for further refinement and feature engineering.
